# agot-lcg-2-full-collection-decks
A list of 40 decks for A Game of Thrones LCG 2.0 including all the cards of the game.

## Goals

This is a list of 40 pre-constructed decks that utilize all the cards in the game. With a few exceptions, each card is present in only one deck, in one, two, or three copies, so that the decks can be physically composed without disassembling and reassembling them for each game.

Specifically, the decks are composed following these guidelines.

- The following sets are used:
  - Core Set;
  - the 8 faction sets;
  - all the sets of the 6 cycles from Westeros Cycle to King's Landing.
  
  Essentially, all official released sets excluding The Things We Do For Love.

- **The decks are built to be as thematic as possible.**

- **The decks are built to be consistent with their combos as possible.**

- Each faction has exactly 5 decks. Actually, the Greyjoy has a deck with The Free Folk agenda, which is not very thematic, but the faction is irrelevant for this deck.

- **All the characters, locations, events and attachments are used**.

- All the agenda cards are used, with the exception of some Banners. Some agendas are used twice, while others are used only once.

- The Redesigns version of the cards are used if present.

- **Each character, location, event and attachment card is present in only one deck**, with the exception of the Core Set "base" economic cards that can be included in more than one deck:
  - the 8 Core Set cost-1 economic character, one for each faction;
  - the 7 Core Set cost-0 economic place, one for each faction except The Night's Watch;
  - the Core Set cost-0 economic event of The Night's Watch (Meager Contribution);
  - The Roseroad;
  - The Kingsroad.

Unfortunately, the decks suffers from the following issues.
- In the current plan, not all plots are used.
- Each plot can use an unlimited number of decks.
- The decks are not guaranteed to be balanced.
- Some decks may lack a solid winning strategy.
